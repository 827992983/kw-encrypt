# kw-encrypt

Hey guys, this is the encryption program I developed in the boring holiday. It can encrypt one or more files into one .KWE file, and decrypt the .KWE file into the original files.

The user interface looks like this. At present, only the basic interface has been completed.

This program should be able to run on a system between Windows XP and windows 10 without any other dependent files. Earlier systems were not tested. You can find the executable in the bin/release directory.
